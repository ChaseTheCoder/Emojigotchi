About emojigotich:  This game is to enterian and reflect on the shortness of a lifespan.  It forces you to focus on life's necessities throughout your whole life jus to surive. By retirement you'll realize how little you spent on things that bring you joy. But mainly, I kept the aging and point increases on the faster side for testing purposes.

# technologies and approach
I utilized HTML with styling through CSS. As a visual learner I first created a wireframe using Figma.com.  Then styled it to match my wireframes using HTML and CSS.  Functions were all coded in JavaScript using loops that intereact with each other using if/else/else if conditional statements.  This was my first time programming a button to initiate a codeblock.

Upon "dying" the skull appears, yet other emojis pop up every now and then.

# reflection
This was my first full project created independently.  I actualy struggled a lot, so much that I scrapped nearly every line of code and started from scratch less than 30 hours before it was due.  However, I'm pleased with the final project since it looks like a fairly modern website and is fully functional.  I plan to have someone review my outline of my code.  When I began the second time I wrote everything I needed to do on paper to map out each code block.  As a teacher, I know the importance of planning for every scenario and reaching out if I have questions ahead of time.  This situation I learned the importance of doing that while coding.
